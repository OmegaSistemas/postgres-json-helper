# postgres-json-helper

Small example of how to work with JSON with persistence in PostgreSQL, has Schema validation and default values.

Uses Sequelize, AJV and deepmerge, check the folder ```example``` to see how works.

## Disclaimer

This is just a set of libraries I joined to assist in migrating from NoSQL to Postgres databases, I felt the lack of validation of the existing JSON Schema in Mongoose and Ottoman.
